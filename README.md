# landing_page
This is a project example of a brand page for an influencer or an individual, in my case a software engineer. I love front end styling.
This will be a full stack appclication with complete backend functionality using Python and Flask and MySQL. it is in the early stages of development but wnated to share sa I work along.
Normally I'd create front-end, back-end and DB as I go along and follow the lifecycle of the program, but I wanted to switch it up for this project and completely build out the front end using bootstrap and then go back and include all back end and database code to complete it. 
This project includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap. On the back end it will include Python and most likely flask, but maybe Django and MySQL.
Thx for viewing!
